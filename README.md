# Following Along with a Musician Through Sheet Music
By Sylvia Tan and Alexander Song
### Project Overview
Today, many musicians face the dilemna of figuring out how to turn the page of their sheet music while continuing to play the last few notes on the previous page. For instruments that require two hands, it is not possible to complete both as while turning the page a hand will have to leave the instrument. Our project hopes to solve this issue. We will create a program that will flip the sheet music when necessary by following along with a musician through the sheet music by comparing pitch and time data from audio detection to pitch and time data from optical music recognition.
